\noindent The grinding process is a step in the metallographic test to produce a flat, smooth sample. The visual determination of samples makes the sample preparation time long enough. Therefore, a quality-based surface-test material is developed to measure the level of fineness of the sample. Samples grinding result is taken its image. The digital image of the sample will be processed using image processing which includes, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. The analyzed sample will be displayed in the form of a Graphical User Inteface (GUI) based decision that the sample can continue the process or repeat the preparation process. The results of this study are expected to help determine the level of surface quality of the materials in metallographic test preparation.
